# String-Class
Not a whole lot to say about this.


Made for an assignment given to me by Esmeralda Salamone.


I estimate I spent about 5 hours coding and 4 hours researching. This is my first time dealing with overloading the stream operators, as well as memory management in C++. Coming from C# this was an interesting experience.
